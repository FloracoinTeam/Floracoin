Floracoin is token based on the Solana blockchain created by Rajit Mukhopadhyay, Eashan Siddalingaiah, and Allen Du in February 2022. 

## Goals

Most popular cryptocurrencies consume massive amounts of electricity to verify transactions. The vast majority of the world's electricity is generated by burning fossil fuels, so we created Floracoin to promote more environmentally friendly alternatives.

Additionally, we developed Floracoin as a learning exercise and because it seemed like a fun little project.

In the future, we may develop our own blockchain.
