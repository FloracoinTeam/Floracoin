Floracoin is token based on the Solana blockchain created by Eashan Siddalingaiah, Rajit Mukhopadhyay, and Allen Du in February 2022. 

## Goals

Most popular cryptocurrencies consume massive amounts of electricity to verify transactions. The vast majority of the world's electricity is generated by burning fossil fuels, so we created Floracoin as a more environmentally freindly alternative.

Additionally, we developed Floracoin as a learning excersize and because it seemed like a fun little project.

In the future, we may develop our own blockchain.
